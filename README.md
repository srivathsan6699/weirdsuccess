Target Costing: Explanation and Evaluation
Target costing is a strategic method used by companies to design and produce products that meet market demands while staying profitable. Instead of starting with production costs and adding a profit margin (the traditional cost-plus method), target costing works backward. It begins by identifying the price customers are willing to pay and subtracts the desired profit, leaving the target cost. This ensures that products are both affordable for customers and profitable for the company. As Ansari and Bell (1997) emphasize, this approach is essential for modern businesses to remain competitive.
Understanding Target Costing
The basic formula of target costing is:
Target Price – Target Profit = Target Cost.
The target price is derived from the market's expectations, influenced by competition and customer preferences. The desired profit is set by the company based on its financial goals. The remaining amount is the target cost, which must cover all production expenses. This simple yet strategic approach ensures that pricing aligns with market realities.
Ansari and Bell (1997) identified six principles that guide the target costing process:
1.	Price-Led Costing: Pricing begins with market expectations, not internal production costs.
2.	Customer Focus: Products are designed to meet customer needs and preferences.
3.	Cross-Functional Teams: Teams from various departments work together to achieve cost targets.
4.	Design for Life-Cycle Cost Reduction: Cost savings are considered throughout the product's life cycle, including maintenance and disposal.
5.	Value Chain Involvement: Suppliers, partners, and stakeholders collaborate to optimize costs.
6.	Focus on Product and Process Design: Early-stage design decisions ensure cost efficiency.
Implementation of Target Costing
Implementing target costing is a complex process. It starts with extensive market research to determine the target price and profit. Cross-functional teams, including representatives from marketing, engineering, finance, and suppliers, collaborate to design products within the allowable cost limits. This iterative process involves negotiations and adjustments to meet both customer expectations and financial targets.
A key challenge in implementation is integrating the six principles simultaneously. As noted by Ansari et al. (2007), picking and choosing among these principles often leads to suboptimal results. Instead, the process must be managed as a cohesive system.
The Role of History: Lessons from Ford, Volkswagen, and Mercedes
The origins of target costing can be traced back to the early 20th century. Henry Ford applied price-led costing in 1908 with the Model T, aiming to produce a car that was affordable, reliable, and easy to maintain. Ford's success was driven by high-volume production and low costs, making the Model T accessible to a broad audience (Nixon, 2022).
Similarly, in the 1930s, Volkswagen used target costing principles to design the Beetle, a car intended for mass affordability. These early examples show how aligning product design with market pricing can drive success.
However, Mercedes-Benz faced significant challenges when it adopted target costing in the 1990s. Traditionally, Mercedes relied on cost-plus pricing and focused on over-engineering to differentiate its products. This strategy became unsustainable when Japanese competitors like Toyota and Nissan introduced luxury vehicles at lower prices (Lorenz, 1993). Mercedes had to shift to target costing, requiring a cultural and organizational overhaul. This transformation involved adopting market-oriented design processes and collaborating closely with suppliers to meet cost targets.
Advantages of Target Costing - MCCS
1.	Market Competitiveness: By starting with customer expectations, companies can create products that meet market demands and stand out from competitors (Ansari & Bell, 1997).
2.	Cost Control: Early-stage cost planning reduces waste and ensures efficiency throughout the product life cycle.
3.	Collaboration and Innovation: Cross-functional teams foster innovation by bringing together diverse perspectives.
4.	Sustainability: Target costing can incorporate environmental goals, such as reducing material waste or energy consumption, alongside financial targets.
For example, Volkswagen applied these principles successfully in the development of Bentley models. Using techniques like Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) and Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), they optimized both costs and product quality (Nixon, 2022).

Challenges and Limitations - CCRR
1.	Complex Implementation: Managing the integration of various teams and suppliers can be time-consuming and resource intensive.
2.	Cultural Resistance: Shifting from cost-plus to target costing requires a cultural change, as seen in Mercedes-Benz's transition. Engineering-led processes had to give way to market-oriented strategies, which was met with internal resistance (Lorenz, 1993).
3.	Reliance on Accurate Data: Incorrect market price estimates or volume predictions can lead to unachievable cost targets, risking financial losses.
4.	Risk of Over-Focus on Costs: Excessive cost-cutting may compromise product quality or innovation, potentially harming the brand.

Critical Evaluation
Target costing is not merely a costing technique; it is a strategic tool that aligns organizational processes with market demands. Its success depends on the ability to integrate multiple disciplines, including marketing, engineering, and finance. As demonstrated by Toyota and Volkswagen, companies that adopt target costing effectively can achieve sustainable competitive advantages.
However, the method's reliance on accurate market data and collaborative efforts highlights its challenges. Without strong leadership and a supportive culture, implementation can falter. As Ansari and Bell (1997) argue, target costing principles must be applied as a cohesive system, not in isolation.
Additionally, while target costing ensures cost efficiency, it may sometimes prioritize short-term profitability over long-term innovation. Striking the right balance is critical for sustained success.
Conclusion
Target costing is a powerful approach to achieving cost control, market alignment, and profitability. By focusing on customer needs and fostering cross-functional collaboration, it enables companies to stay competitive in dynamic industries. Historical examples like Ford and Volkswagen highlight its effectiveness, while Mercedes’ transformation underscores its challenges. Although target costing requires significant effort and cultural change, its benefits far outweigh the difficulties. For modern businesses, mastering target costing is essential for growth and sustainability.




Ethics and Compliance (E&C) Programs: Importance, Frameworks, and Real-Time Applications
Ethics and compliance (E&C) are essential frameworks for promoting integrity and accountability in businesses, ensuring adherence to legal requirements, and fostering public trust. Over the past decades, E&C programs have evolved from vague concepts to well-structured, legally binding systems aimed at preventing corporate misconduct and ensuring effective governance. 
The Foundations of Ethics and Compliance
Ethics and compliance programs are rooted in the need to safeguard corporate accountability and prevent fraud. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) pioneered this concept with its Federal Sentencing Guidelines in 1991, which emphasized a culture of ethical conduct and compliance with the law. The goal was to build public trust in companies by implementing systems of internal control and risk management to detect and prevent fraud.
Historical cases like Enron (2002) and WorldCom highlighted the catastrophic consequences of unethical behaviour at the leadership level. These scandals exposed how corporate crimes are often perpetrated by those in power, leading to significant reforms such as the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX) of 2002. This legislation focused on establishing accountability at the top levels of management, often referred to as the "tone at the top" (Schilit, 2002)
Frameworks and Regulations for E&C Programs
Various regulatory frameworks guide the development and implementation of E&C programs. The most notable include the COSO framework, the Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), the OECD Good Practice Guidance, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) guidelines.
1. The COSO Framework (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission)
The COSO framework is widely recognized for providing a comprehensive approach to internal control, which includes financial reporting, operational effectiveness, and compliance. It consists of five components:
•	Control Environment: Establishing the organizational culture and ethical tone.
•	Risk Assessment: Identifying and analyzing risks.
•	Control Activities: Implementing policies and procedures to address identified risks.
•	Information and Communication: Ensuring that relevant information is shared across the organization.
•	Monitoring Activities: Continuous evaluation of the system’s effectiveness.
The COSO framework is integral to understanding internal control over financial reporting (ICFR), and its principles have been incorporated into both SOX and international regulations like J-SOX (Japanese Sarbanes-Oxley Act), which mandates internal control evaluations for public companies in Japan.

2. Sarbanes-Oxley Act (SOX), 2002
The SOX Act was enacted to strengthen corporate governance and enhance the accuracy of financial reporting in the wake of scandals such as Enron and WorldCom. The act emphasizes the importance of the "tone at the top," which refers to the ethical behavior of senior management and directors. This is crucial because, as history has shown, many of the most significant corporate frauds have involved top executives (e.g., Enron, Carillion). Under SOX, companies are required to establish robust internal controls, conduct regular audits, and provide transparent financial statements.
The act also introduced the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to oversee external auditors and ensure their independence in evaluating financial statements.
3. OECD Good Practice Guidance (2010)
In 2010, the OECD issued guidance to promote ethics and integrity within organizations, urging companies to implement comprehensive E&C systems. This guidance emphasizes the need for an integrated approach to risk management, internal controls, and corporate culture. The OECD recommends that companies foster a culture of integrity, which is a key theme in many E&C programs today.
4. Department of Justice (DOJ) Guidelines
The DOJ’s 2023 guidelines provide a framework for evaluating corporate compliance programs, focusing on areas like risk assessment, training, internal reporting, and enforcement of ethical standards. These guidelines encourage companies to create systems that not only prevent violations but also detect and respond to misconduct quickly.

Evaluating E&C Programs
Effective evaluation of E&C programs is essential to ensuring they achieve their intended outcomes. Several key areas must be assessed to evaluate the effectiveness of E&C systems:
•	Tone at the Top: The integrity of senior management sets the ethical tone for the entire organization. Key questions to assess this include whether ethical behavior is rewarded, how management responds to unethical behavior, and if there is a transparent process for reporting misconduct.
•	Risk Management: An effective E&C program must include a robust risk management system that identifies, evaluates, and mitigates potential risks. For example, the evaluation of internal controls over financial reporting (ICFR) ensures that financial statements are accurate and that fraud is detected early.
•	Whistleblower Protections: A strong whistleblowing system is crucial for encouraging employees to report unethical practices without fear of retaliation. Many organizations have established hotlines or anonymous reporting systems as part of their E&C initiatives.
•	Regular Audits: Internal and external audits play a critical role in assessing the adequacy of internal controls and ensuring compliance with regulatory standards. These audits should be conducted regularly and cover both financial and non-financial aspects of the business.






Real-Time Examples of E&C Implementation
Several companies provide real-time examples of successful E&C implementation.
1.	McDonald’s: McDonald’s has long adhered to the COSO framework and internal control standards. Its annual reports are detailed and comply with global financial reporting requirements, emphasizing transparency and the ethical standards upheld by its senior management. The company’s commitment to integrity is reinforced through its supplier code of conduct, employee ethics training, and a robust whistleblower program.
2.	Volkswagen: The Volkswagen emissions scandal in 2015 highlighted the importance of strong E&C programs. The company faced severe consequences after it was found to have cheated emissions tests. This scandal showed how a lack of strong internal controls, transparency, and ethical behavior at the top can lead to disastrous consequences for the company and its stakeholders.
3.	Carillion: The UK-based construction company Carillion’s collapse in 2018 was a direct result of poor corporate governance and unethical accounting practices. Despite having an E&C program in place, Carillion’s top executives were found to have overstated profits and hidden debts, leading to its eventual bankruptcy. This case exemplifies the need for effective monitoring, transparent reporting, and a genuine culture of ethics at the top.
Conclusion
E&C programs are vital for ensuring ethical conduct, compliance with legal standards, and the long-term sustainability of businesses. Regulatory frameworks like the COSO framework, SOX, OECD guidance, and DOJ guidelines provide organizations with the necessary tools to design and evaluate their E&C programs. Real-time examples from companies like McDonald’s and Carillion highlight both the successes and failures of these programs in practice. Ultimately, the effectiveness of an E&C program depends on the integrity of senior leadership, the transparency of financial reporting, and the strength of internal controls. By adhering to these principles, organizations can prevent corporate misconduct, maintain trust with stakeholders, and safeguard their reputation in the marketplace.
